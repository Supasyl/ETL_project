# ETL PROJECT 

#### **DESCRIPTION / OUTLINE**
As a small data analytics firm, our client approached us with an urgent project to collect information about this year’s LEGO sets. They are part of the manufacturing process of LEGO pieces; and want to do predictive data modelling to find out what materials will be more in demand next year, based on this year’s information, so that they can optimise their manufacturing process.

They have requested the information be put into database format so that it can be accessed in a way that they are already familiar with.
